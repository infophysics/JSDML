# JSDML
Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Machine Learning Toolbox

The JSDML is a python implementation of a neural network using Keras/Tensorflow which also includes functionality to calculate
the JSD between features and classes.  Some of the functionality is borrowed from Greg Ver Steeg's package NPEET
(https://github.com/gregversteeg/NPEET).

A quick start guide and full documentation are included along with examples.  Any questions can be directed to the authors at
ncarrara@albany.edu.
